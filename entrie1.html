            You can’t miss the fact that solo travel’s become one of the biggest travel trends of the past few years. From being the province of long-term backpackers or dismissed as just for singles looking for romance, the number of people travelling solo has rocketed by 150% since 2011. More and more people are discovering you don’t have to wait to find someone to go with if you want to see the world. 
            And solo travel has lots of benefits – it can help build confidence, push you out of your comfort zone and means you can do what you want to without having to compromise.

            If you’re nervous trying a solo trip, a short break is the perfect introduction. A long weekend is enough time to try it out but short enough that it’s not too intimidating if you’re worried about whether you’ll like it. And if you combine it with ticking something off your bucket list, you’re guaranteed to come back with good memories. Solo travel is a great excuse to be selfish, so choose a place you’ve always wanted to see – Riga, Stockholm and Split top my wishlist.

Iceland has exploded in popularity recently, and it’s a great place to start your solo travel adventures – it’s small enough that you can see a lot in a few days, there’s tons of things to do, English is widely spoken and it’s well set up for tourism. On The Go Tours have a five-day escape to Iceland to spot the Northern Lights, as well as watching geysers erupt, swimming in the Blue Lagoon and exploring dramatic waterfalls. If you choose the option to share a room there’s no single supplement, but you can pay a bit extra if you prefer your privacy.

            Who wouldn’t be tempted by the idea of an all-inclusive holiday in the Caribbean, with spa treatments and activities included along with food, drink and white-sand beaches? It’s the type of holiday solo travellers might think is more geared up for couples, but there’s a lot more to the Caribbean than honeymoons – it just depends on choosing the right island and resort.

The Body Holiday in St Lucia has Queen-size four-poster beds in its single garden rooms: no supplement for this solo escape, but also no chance of sleeping in a cupboard-sized room on a single bed if you’re travelling on your own. The resort even dedicates September to solo travellers, with a string of events and activities from yoga, abseiling and scuba diving to food made with ingredients from the resort’s garden – check out Tropical Sky for special offers.
